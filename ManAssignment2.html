<h1>A Few Quick Facts</h1>

<h2>Set 1</h2>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>The British Army’s shift to the Southern theater was the setup for the Battle of Guilford Courthouse. In 1778, the British shifted their focus to the Southern colonies. This change in strategy was because of the greater number of Loyalists in those colonies. They found success in Savannah, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina. Their primary goal was to finish off the remains of the American army in the South.</li>
  <li>General Nathanael Green, an American, made decisions that also impacted the Battle. Greene decided to separate and fortify his forces to prepare for the British. His plans led to the Battle of Cowpens and a subsequent pursuit by General Cornwallis of the British.</li>
  <li>The outcome of the Battle of Cowpens directly led to the Battle of Guilford Courthouse. After the battle, Greene retreated to Virginia to resupply. Cornwallis pursued his army before settling at the Dan River, according to History.com. Meanwhile, Greene returned to North Carolina and set camp at Guilford Courthouse. This is where the battle would take place.
</ul>

<h2>Set 2</h2>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>The Battle of Guilford Courthouse actually took place in two places: the Guilford Courthouse, a local law court in Greensboro; and the Hoskins Farm, a small, abandoned piece of farmland. According to the National Park Service, there were 3 lines of American infantry. The first line took cover behind the fences of the Hoskins Farm. The second line was hidden in the dense woods between the Hoskins Farm and the Guilford Courthouse. The third line was back at the Courthouse and the nearby hills.</li> 
  <li>The man-made structures and forested terrain gave the Americans a slight advantage in their positioning. The Hoskins Farm was utilized by the first American line as cover. The fences around the property allowed them to take cover and fire on the British forces. The land around the farm was mostly open fields, forcing the British into a vulnerable position.</li> 
</ul>
