<h1>After the Battle</h1>

<div class="AftermathEnds">
<p>As the British advanced on the 3rd American line, one of the units--the 2nd Maryland--was forced to run,
depriving the Americans of artillery support. As the two sides clashed in close quarters, Cornwallis decided
to fire his artillery into the mass. This resulted in a lot of friendly fire, but it also created an opportunity
for the British to move into the gaps in the American lines. Greene decided to withdraw before that happened.

The British were tactically victorious, gaining control of the courthouse. Cornwallis repeatedly decided
against following the retreating Americans, wanting to preserve his remaining forces. He eventually went
back to British-controlled Wilmington to rebuild his army, and it would have seemed like the Southern 
Colonies were now in his control.
</p>

<p>
However, the British fared less well strategically, with many calling the battle a "phyrric" victory.
Almost a quarter of the initial British forces became casualties, leaving Cornwallis unable to follow up
on his victory. The gains he made in North Carolina and the rest of the South were only temporary, and 
Cornwallis was forced to find a different strategy.

Ultimately, Guilford Courthouse is just the largest example of how the British fared in the South:
victories at a heavy cost. While the southern campaign saw a lot of early success, the unsustainable
casualties of later reversed much of their gains. With the situation in the South deteriorating,
Cornwallis decided to switch his focus to Virginia in specific.
