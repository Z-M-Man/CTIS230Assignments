<p>
Some of the American forces were part of the Continental Army, organized by the Continental Congress to represent the new United States.
 A significant part of the Americans, however, were state militias and local volunteers.<br>
The Americans at Guilford Courthouse were led by Major General Nathanael Greene.<br>
Greene organized his forces into three lines: the first was composed of the inexperienced North Carolina militia, the second was composed of the more experienced Virginia militia, and the third was composed of trained Continentals.<br>
In total, Greene commanded 4,100 Americans.<br>
