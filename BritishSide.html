<h1>Great Britain, the Attackers</h1>
<p>
The British Army was mainly composed of regulars--standard infantry. They are more well-known as the "Redcoats," for their distinct red uniforms.<br>
In addition to standard soldiers, Loyalist militias and German mercenaries were also used to bolster forces.<br>
The British campaign in the Southern States was led by Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis.<br>
In the weeks preceding the battle, Cornwallis had around 2,440 men. However, due to desertion and disease, he was left with around 2,100 when the battle occurred.<br>
